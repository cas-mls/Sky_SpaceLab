## Possible Fix

### Score not Resetting

The 1000 score is not resetting when the reset button is pressed. The number doesn't move.  If I manually reset the scoring drum to zero, then the machine work ok.

 1. Score Reset Relay for 1000 Point Cam contact cleaning.

### Tilt switches are too sensitive

1. Coin slap
2. Plumb Bob
3. Lift Ball
4. Kick
5. Under the playing area
